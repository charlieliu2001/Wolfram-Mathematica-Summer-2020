# Wolfram-Mathematica-Summer-2020
A collection of the final versions of the programs that I wrote for graduate students at China Agricultural University for use in their research.

Because Github does not support Wolfram Mathematica notebooks, I can only upload them here as PDFs. The programs are uploaded in my Wolfram Mathematica repository for download if interested.
